I am an incoming law student at the University of Toronto. Previously, I was a PhD student in MIT's Department of Linguistics. My broad linguistic interests include syntax, semantics, pragmatics, fieldwork, and acquisition. My broad legal interests are as of yet undetermined. I was born and raised in Toronto and moved to the US to complete a B.A. in linguistics at Yale (2018). I then headed back home to Canada to pursue a M.A. in linguistics at the University of British Columbia, and then a PhD at MIT starting in 2020. 

Outside of linguistics, I have written for publications including [Slate](https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/07/linguistic-prejudice-in-sorry-to-bother-you-is-a-real-world-problem.html), Dig Boston and Racked, and I occasionally blog about linguistics and adjacent topics on [Medium](https://medium.com/@focusfronting). A not-particularly-current version of my CV can be found <a href="CV-2.pdf">here</a>.
